# The Northern Job
V2.1.0  

You're a seasoned stalker. You've disabled the **Miracle Machine** fought off the Monolith at the barrier and turned off the **Brain Scorcher**.  
When you're adventuring on the North you don't give the slightest care in the world about stuff that needs to be done South, so why should anyone bother you with Southern concerns?  

This mod checks if you're on a Northern map looking for a job. If you're then it will filter out all tasks that would send you down South. You've spent enough time there fixing it. Now you've got more pressing matters elsewhere.

Now since **The Job Can Wait** will become part of G.A.M.M.A. I actually already handled it as if it were part of it, so `The Job Can Wait` is a pre-requisite!

## Tasks included
All vanilla anomaly tasks are accounted for (in theory) with 1 exception
- Bounty
  - Capture Enemy Documents
- Spy extraction
- Assault
- Delivery
- Fate/Lost Signal
- Anomaly measurement?!
  
The exception: Guide tasks.  
When you're North and the game rolls you a guide task it will be North location -> North location.  
Only Red Forest has guide tasks that can send you South, but I decided to not filter those since then they would basically disappear forever from the task pool.

iTheon's tasks:
- Stolen specimen
- Shakedown
- Blood Stained Coin

## Installation
Pre-requisite mod: [The Job Can Wait](https://github.com/Bence7661/Serious_The_Job_Can_Wait) install this as first step. If you use `New levels 0.53` mod then you'll find the compatibility patch here too. You only need to apply the compatibility patch to `The Job Can Wait`.
Just drop it below `The Job Can Wait` (So if **The Job Can Wait** has a priority of 1 then **The Northern Job** should have a priority of 2).
